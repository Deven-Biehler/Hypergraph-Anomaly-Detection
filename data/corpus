brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness brutalism as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether more recently brutalism has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or

globe eximus mobile globe and the nullifiers shields these abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game ive been running massive amounts of t4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become however this is also because i have high rof weapons in my t4 load out the nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled globes this means explosive munitions ie penta nades ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it \r\ranother thing de should consider is removing the damage limit on shields its pretty ridiculous how high rof weapons are better against nullifier shields ive noticed this is only on nullifiers that slow high damage weapons to put this into perspective my boltor prime shoots spikes that deal 800 damage to the nullifier shields my opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag 5 shots 9 shots with multishot to take the shield down de needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high rof and slow rof weapons to be viable\r\ran idea ive been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs blast procs can cc enemies inside the shield while magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself by introducing this mechanic void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons\r\r\rtldr 1 unify rules with regard to out of body shields players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own\r\r2 remove damage limit on shields to make slow rof weapons viable against nullifiers\r\r3 add elemental weaknesses to the shields bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void", "dual ichors are still the king of my ash

cards\n\ni deliberately made arcane unraveling do nothing in aggressive matchups although technically it could net value with mad scientist because i think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue all the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control but 5 additional cards 5 turns when youre not taking fatigue seems absolutely insane to me also this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with secrets and have mad scientistesque effects into the game id gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card but i think against control it could be insanely useful\n\ni think shadow summoner doesnt produce an insane amount of burn at all you pay 9 mana just to get the first shadow bomber on board 6 for the card 2 for hero power 1 for the bomber and you can only hero power once per turn if you have pressure to go along with it then yes it will do work but on its own i dont think its that strong at all\n\nfor tinkerer i imagined this card less as a jeeves who simply allows any class to be zoo and more like a minigazlowe i think if you even have two cards on board that generate spare parts like a gnome and yeti and you trade them in this card gives you value two extra spare parts with gazlowe or antonidas or even auctioneer is really good and youre not paying too much to get them \n\nbeastmaster can have synergy with hunter cards obviously allowing you to houndmaster anything enable kill command etc etc this can let you do stuff like turn 4 yeti turn 5 beastmaster  houndmaster or turn 3 harvest golem turn 4 coin beastmaster houndmaster basically it allows a workaround for there being a low number of good beasts in the game it also synergizes with druid of the fang i dont know if thats enough to make beast druid viable but i think its worth considering and the most important part for me it is a vastly superior black knight  mark of the wild with hemet nesingwary a 6 mana assassinate that also summons a 63 and a 21 \n\ngenerator is insane if you can get value from it but you have to run the paladin secrets in exchange which are pretty mediocre and they wont get amazing value with the board state except for avenge redemption will be bad if they kill the generator noble sacrifice wont be spectacular and the other ones will be garbage as usual\n\nill agree that shadowy archer is too strong do you think making it a 12 would be fine still better than creeper but it is a class card\n\nfor the tortoise it does seem limited but i think in a deck with a lot of card draw or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws playing 22s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game a comparison could be made with hogger in terms of how 22 taunts can snowball out of control also its a beast though i dont know how useful that is\n\ni didnt consider the shade comparison with fel imp at all i think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker when making it i was thinking of the synergy with floating watcher you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once also with blood imp on board he grows faster than shade as well although not by much hes probably a much worse play in the early game but i think when you can play him and a few healthbuffing effects immediately he shines\n\nfor neighborhood blacksmith i think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons but then you cant use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have and if you only get a few more charges then hes pretty comparable to greenskin  with 1 minion hes just worse with 2 its arguable 11 on the weapon but 2 attack so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better greenskin which for current warrior decks isnt that easy to

wrong topic or got confused  this post was about tight rulesets not about balance but you seem to use those interchangably  you can make tight rules with an unbalanced system or a balanced system with not tight rules\n\nif it was about balance well warmachinehordes is one system that supports 14 full factions and warhammer 40k has 18 really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions  fantasy doesnt have to be balanced against 40k so its not included  so the difference isnt so great  unless you think the jump from 14 to 1618 factions really breaks the camels back there but i cant see it\n\n\n\n\nbut back to the tight ruleset   warhammer 40ks main rules problem isnt the vast number of rules  its not the minute rules interactions  really the core problem is the rules arent written in a systematic fashion\n\na systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system\n\n40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing leading to confusion\n\n40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english  most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule then they write it down in the confines of the rules set\n\nto use an example earlier today  a single passenger can fire out of each fire point  this is a poor rule as it stands because the timing is not defined and 40k doesnt even have a definition for what firing means  do you fire psychic shooting attacks  are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons\n\na tighter defined rules set would have defined fire as making a ranged attack and ranged attacks as psychic shooting etc  it would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is\n\nto use an example from a comprehensive ruleset in magic theres a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana  in 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads all blue lands produce an extra mana  \n\nthat would be a terrible rule  produce is not defined it doesnt say when they make the extra mana when they produce do they produce two  do they produce one now and one at the normal time  theres just a lot of problems with that wording you know this without even playtesting it\n\nthats why magic words it until end of turn whenever a player taps an island for mana that player adds blue to his or her mana pool   the timing is defined tap is a defined term in the rules everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset\n\njust reading through different games rulesets you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from  its not the minor interactions that come from having so many

her caden tries to tell her that yes she has blood he wants to feel a bit of himself is in olive but adele tells olive that she doesnt have blood saying caden is not in olive which allows her to

if you can resolve their issue by the end of the call\n\nat least thats my opinion on it", "i get the feeling youve never done customer support much less for one in a large call center environment for a faceless corporation\n\n1  comcast likely outsources the support to another company or companies  usually companies diversify their support so that differently owned call centers are directly competing with others so they dont get complacent  they can look at reports and say x call center is doing better than y lets give a higher percent of the call volume to x  how well a call center does as a whole directly impacts job security  so to say comcast hired the person it might be true if comcast is the one doing the support but id be pretty skeptical that they do  generally if comcast is outsourcing they arent equipped to deal with some random employee of a company they outsource work to in an individual basis  you dont see the outliers when all the data has been averaged\n\n2  customers call in wanting free stuff all the time  i mean all the fucking time  they will have all sorts of creative stories that may or may not be true claiming previous agents told them theyd get free this or that usually things that cannot ever be promised  and even if the customer is telling the truth that an agent told them that the agent will carefully omit that from their case notes to bring less attention to themselves should the customer call back  the only way theyd get caught is if the call was randomly picked to get reviewed  the 2nd agent is only going to have the customers word vs the previous agents notes which may not confirm what the customer is claiming is accurate  now in this case he has it recorded but does that truly prove to her that he didnt have a friend record it with him  at any rate if she isnt supposed to do it its not worth risking her job over satisfying one customer  in her mind do you think she cares more about his 12 a month than her own job security  absolutely not\n\n3  she many not even be capable of offering what hes claiming  ive had to deal with people who were promised things we cannot do and i couldnt fulfill them either  and thats not a case of well get your supervisor to do it  i was the supervisor  the next level above me was escalated cases and there was a specific guideline for what gets escalated  a customer supposedly being promised something we literally cannot do was not a valid escalation scenario  before you say well escalate it anyway and let them handle it it doesnt work like that  knowingly escalating an invalid case too often gives more backend work to the team that handles those which end up deescalated anyway as invalid  they dont even get to see the case as the team that approves it would flag it  too many invalid escalations can result in a corrective action form getting written up  getting 2 cafs in 6 months would lead to the agent being terminated\n\n4  within the context of the company i worked for giving something away for free was called empowerment  it was doing something outside the normal policy to keep the customer happy and we had limited scope of what we could use it for  this generally required approval as a supervisor i didnt need external approval and was tracked as a percentage of how many calls where you gave away empowerment  the goal was to not exceed 3 per month and anything over 5 would get investigated into  so if i legitimately had 20 calls where 2 people had a valid reason for receiving compensation from us for an issue that is on our end it wouldve been in my best interest to only give it to 1 and in most cases that tends to be the first person not the second one\n\n5 playing back the previous recording was likely a bad choice on his part  that will flag the new agent that hes likely recording her call as well and shes going to do everything by the books  she cant get in trouble for denying him the 12 month promotion if thats what her documentspolicies tell her to do\n\nyou try to boil it down to well comcast is obligated to follow through with it but its never that simple  the more likely outcome is the agent that handled the first call will get written up or fired  and now that its gone viral to a degree comcast may try to make it right  for the average customer though their call isnt going to go viral and there are too many degrees of separation to get approval to make it right or you have no proof the customer is telling the truth so you err on the side of caution by denying them  there are just so many factors

mutter something unintelligible just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on\n\n\u201cfucking mondays\u201d he said aloud beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise he rolled over and put an arm around her smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth envying her ability to sleep through anything \n\nthen over

were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready \n\n\u201cpolice police\u201d they yelled as they progressed through the house they came upon his family huddled on the bed in jake and sue\u2019s bedroom  \u201ceverybody on the floor everybody down get on the floor\u201d\n\njake was in front of his family his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could\n\n\u201con the

here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them\n\n\u201con the fucking ground now\u201d the point man shouted the other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons the point man grabbed jake\u2019s wrist and yanked him off of the bed throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back the second man in grabbed his wife\u2019s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream\n\n\u201chey\u201d jake shouted pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see \u201cstop hurting my wife\u201d his arm was grabbed twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist\n\n\u201cstop resisting\u201d the man on top of jake yelled\n\na third man came into the room grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor she yelled as he did so and began crying loudly\n\n\u201cstop you motherfuckers\u201d jake yelled \n\nthe person on top of him put an elbow into his face \u201cshut up and stop resisting\u201d he twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking he tried to roll over but had no leverage this prompted another elbow to the face he tried throw the guy again this time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed \n\nunder normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back but this was a father protecting his family a split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser flailing the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself jake now on his feet barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed\n\nhe had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact both went rolling jake ended up on the bottom the man threw several punches and landed a few on jake\u2019s face then paused and reached behind himself jake took a swing at the man\u2019s face but his fist missed the free end of the half fastened handcuff did not it struck the man squarely in the cheekbone making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto jake that sent the man\u2019s hands to his face as he let out what would have been if not for the circumstances a comically effeminate scream jake did not notice all he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him\n\njake struggled to his knees pushing the man off of him and got to his feet the other person clearing the house hearing the struggle now made his way down the hall and into the room seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him he went into kill mode he raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as jake came at him the sound was instant and sharp quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying the helicopters outside everything to a high pitched ring\n\njake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum was not aware of the 223 round\u2019s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts spilling bile and blood where it should not go jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor this time jake was on top rage consumed him viciously he punched the man trying to destroy him his very existence over and over his fist made contact with the man\u2019s face nose mouth teeth cut his knuckles which began to

asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate  i figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old founded in 1985 and the customer list and registration to do business with the government\n\nthe company served the clients mentioned  mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras  thats pretty much what the business did  one of the atlantic financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didnt   \n\nthe company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again  we considered pursuing some government business but didnt  the company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on  the internal employee working on it moved on   the small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase  \n\ni had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and im a disabled vet  but i never used that certification or pursued those lines of business  its really not my cup of

it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward\n\nwe scrapped all the inventory delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with   the company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years\n\nat the time  2004 or so i was not as adamantly against the government as i am now  i had some interest in some types of government contracts  i didnt pursue them but some of the work such as usaid efforts in pakistan and security work interested me  i didnt pursue it it doesnt interest me now and i dont do any government work now   even the tiny bit of work that this

increase combustion temperature if you continue to lean there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down \n\nwhat i am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not cht temp is critical imho because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer

clever lad with a seer stone could figure it out since he was in new york and since there is little elaboration on his actual acquisition of his stone ill figure it was a circular template with either geez or aramaic written language from some exhibition nearby \n\nnow i mentioned aramaic and its probably a language you know of i doubt you know what geezpronounced how it looks is it is the language

the women they failed to attract by turning women into the enemy it tells boys that its not their fault its the fault of the woman who are inherently out to get men and who only care about their

valuable while young and naive while totally failing to tell them what healthy relationships are like \n\neven the core idea is a cognitive dissonance women occupy all of their mental real estate and they twist and contort themselves to get their attention engaging in elaborate plots and acting out scripts and making pretty much their entire life about bettering themselves so that women will want them then they claim that they have found a revelation about how not to be controlled by women yeah right making yourself into a guard doesnt get you out of jail it just makes you the slave of the

massive amounts of incidental harm to the women they date and any children unfortunate enough to be born to them \n\nit doesnt even work to pick up women anyone who approaches lots of women will

for and ignoring red flags left right and center self fulfilling prophecy  if you expect women to be evil and materialistic and manipulative you dont blink when you find one that acts that way  and she will date you because shes used to men running for the hills when they figure out what she is \n\nso yeah have fun defending the redpill be another sucker who falls for something cooked up by

my blackberry i wanted a smartphone but iphone was only on atampt a carrier with which i had had horrible experiences with    but verizon was showing off this neat droid incredible phone   i got it it worked great from what i could see it was as good as an iphone with few gaps   it even had builtin voice turnbyturn navigation something that ios wouldnt have for years  \n\nsince then ive just continued to use android mostly because i really use all the android features things like nfc google wallet automation with tasker swipe typing etc so going to ios would always seem like a downgrade   i simply am not willing to lose function ive come to depend upon    i will say that ios has done a good job in catching up particularly with ios 8  but there are still things that are lacking  \n\nill also caveat this by saying that i do use an ipad for work and i do think that ios has done tablets pretty well better than android mostly because i dont tend to use all those advanced functions when using a tablet     but the first thing i did on the ipad was to sweep all the apple stuff into a folder and populate my home screen with google stuff instead   im deeply invested in the googleverse so having google be a first class player on any device is important to me \n\n       2 what are some things you envy about the opposite platform\n\ni like the way that imessage works smoothly   id really like for hangouts to get to that level   id also like for google music to offer the breadth of music you can find on itunes   also as i said before id like for androids tablets to be better   i think they came very close with the nexus 7   i like mine a 2012 3g model that so far is still waiting for lollipop   but it is sluggish now   very different from my ipad    finally id like google to enforce a little more uniformity in its hardware so that we can see a better 3rd party market for things like mounts cases etc  \n\n\n       3 what can you do on your platform that is easier or does not exist on the opposite platform\n\ngoogle now voice integration and moto xs features like the wave to see notificationstime and hands free ok moto search are great   so is 4k video capture    but i still go back to the basics   googles intents system is so advanced compared to ios nascient extensions    to see what i mean use google now to say play music by trans siberian orchestra    when google responds you can just let it play with the default player google music on my phone or you can choose another music player thats on your phone like tunein radio  amazon music spotify pandora etc   you simply cannot do that on ios and it drives me crazy especially since i generally use cloudbased music all the time either spotify or google music   so if i tell  play trans siberian orchestra  to siri it whines about the fact that i dont have their music on my device instead of maybe bringing up spotify  \n\nthat plus automation   i love that you can use things like tasker to do crazy things like push programmable actions from your phone to chromecast or automate certain settings based on time of day location or wifi network name \n"], "2pacalypse9": ["i dont know about you guys

really your only option\n\n2 test a small dosage at the lower range and look for any immediate effects positive or negative note all of them\n\n3 continuing testing with increasing dosages if test 2

evaluate if using the substance is worth having that side effect\n\nif theres no research to indicate long term effects and no immediate benefit at upper intake levels its probably a dud for you and you should move onto better things and not waste your money if theres an immediate positive effect take it as long as you feel safe and have the money to do so if theres a long term positive benefit

purportedly unselfmanaging nature the formation of sovereign bodies has hitherto been performed through hierarchical striation along the boundaries of class dictatorships states serve the good of those bodies that constitute the formative kingmaker class of society that can constitute itself as dictator they do not serve everyone this is evidenced in a myriad of ways but since were arguing on the internet i figure i might as well drop the classic example of the holocaust wherein the state was willing to serve the general welfare of all people only inasmuch as 11 millions of people were considered to be not people\n\nthe state most certainly does not have a monopoly on force in democratic countries the sovereign of the state is the people if the people think they are illgoverned the people can change the government if the government will not change then revolution is the only recourse many governments have been overturned through violent revolutions recent studies have even

would be in the long term interest of women seeking abortions i am now persuaded that it would not be best resolved by prohibition however there is good evidence that a lack of laborers will lead to an economic recession or depression and such a depression will definitely effect billions as japan is the third largest economy in the world\n\ngtcereal is sold at grocery stores milk is sold at grocery stores too grocery stores employ workers lets say we have ten workers who work at a grocery store that exclusively sells cereal and milk lets also say that this grocery store is a monopoly and therefore its sales are representative of aggregate demand for both milk and cereal in the economy where it resides all ten of these workers handle both cereal and milk in their occupational duties if the store were to stop selling cereal because of a government decree that cereal is causing a dangerously negative birth rate but were to continue selling milk the store would still be representative of the aggregate demand for milk the workers formerly charged with sale of both milk and cereal now will be charged solely with the sale of milk however this store represents the aggregate demand they can try to substitute milk for cereal to some extent by diverting productive resources for the sale of cereal to the sale of milk but this effectively will serve the purpose of shifting the price of milk downwards along the demand curve while not substantially recovering the sales normally allocated to cereal the marginal rate of substitution for milk and cereal you see is not perfect to some extent substitution falls flat so even though the store still sells milk and its workers are perfectly trained and capable of selling milk approximately half of the workers will be laid off abortion is cereal other procedures are milk it might not be half but to disregard potential economic effects on the basis that health care professionals have more than one function is irresponsible\n\ni

in half in a few short years\n\nim afraid im not convinced that out of 60 million women a couple hundred thousand of them putting their careers on hold would cut the economy in half\n\ngtwho are you

continuously with new information arriving \n\ngtill top this off with one new argument to keep things fresh immigration policy reform stands a far greater chance at increasing the japanese population

it was there we saw its tracks huge sixfingered paw prints left in the snow we heard its roars deep and unearthly bellows echoing over the frozen lakes the sled dogs were much too terrified of the beast to want to go out there the snowmobiles didnt have the fuel to go track the beast\n\nand no one was going to come in to help us our town was too remote everyone was afraid\n\nnight after night the beast came through our town it roared it snarled it bellowed but no one was brave enough to look at it everyone had their doors locked their lights out their shades drawn to the beast we were as good as dead\n\nwhich would soon be true food was running short we couldnt hold out much longer\n\none day we faced the inevitable we were down to our last cans the stores had long since been picked clean if i didnt go out and find something anything to eat we were going to starve i suited up for the cold armed myself with my fathers hunting rifle and went outside\n\na mile or so outside of town i found deer tracks the beasts prints were nowhere to be seen i followed the tracks into the forest\n\nhour after hour i trudged through the snow but still the deer was nowhere to be seen no matter how far i went the deer had gone still further sunset was fast approaching i would have to go back empty handed\n\nas i turned around to head back the air became very still i stopped and waited nothing happened it was quiet too quiet\n\nand then the wind picked up it grew stronger and stronger whipping up the snow around me very soon i could see nothing but snow and the wind was deafeningly loud it was rapidly getting dark i hurried back as fast as i could but i was hopelessly lost my tracks became obscured in the blizzard i fell to my knees\n\nwithout warning the wind let up and once again everything was quiet night had fallen and i heard breathing heavy breathing i looked up\n\nthe beast stood in front of me it was titanic it had black fur and hideously red eyes its canines were visible and menacingly sharp it was hunched up and staring at me ready to pounce\n\ni scrambled to my feet and aimed at the beast neither of us moved we stared at each other waiting for the other to make the first move\n\ni realized that shooting it would have done me no good it would only make it angrier than it already was so i decided to try the unthinkable\n\ni tossed the rifle to the side and walked towards the beast\n\nthe beast did not move at first then it relaxed and took a few cautious steps toward me we drew closer to each other\n\nwhen we met we stopped neither of us moved we simply took each other in then very slowly and very carefully i reached my hand towards the beast\n\ni laid it gently on the side of its head the beast was still at first then it let the weight of its head into my hand and closed its eyes we remained like this\n\nsuddenly the beast opened its eyes and picked its head back up it turned off to the side and put its face close to the snow it gave a low sonorous growl and the snow cleared off before it in the spot it had cleared a shagawa bush sprouted and grew to full size its berries glistened purple among the snow shining in the starlight the

while others explore their surroundings it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of godhood but the more you have influence over the harder it is to observe every single individual particle\n\nso as you ascend in degrees of godhood you recruit other intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you as you evolve into a more and more complex entity you recruit more and more intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures\n\nthere is a spiritual evolution each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution you organize a more complex spiritual spirit  plasmaelectricity or something very similar form then incarnate into a solid form that matches it after accruing experience in that solid form you return to a purely spiritual form and take what youve learned learning is much easier in a material form and evolve your spiritual body with or without help see below then reincarnate taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form\n\nin addition to reincarnation there is resurrection\n\nresurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter the best of both worlds without the limitations once you reach this point you are ready to take the next step which is to assist other intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies\n\nresurrected beings can reproduce and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own they can reorganize spirits from lower forms too for example a dog to a chimp its possible though much more difficult for an intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body jhvh did this hence why he is called selfcreated once an intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state\n\nafter creating spirit bodies a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit this is what adam and eve did they voluntarily gave up their resurrected state after populating the earth with spirits in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they we could experience the next step\n\nas adam and eve fell so too did the earth from its former place of glory at the center of the galaxy to its present position at the tip of the orion spiral arm adam and eve left the congregation of the elohim hebrew word meaning the gods plural not god singular to rejoin mortality for our benefit later jhvh did the same but whereas adam and eve fell to bring death on themselves jhvh incarnated as the man yeshua ben yusuf of nazareth to bring eternal life on adam and eve and all their

decisionmaking process so here it is part 1 of 3\n\ni began this project for two reasons \n\n 1 i\u2019m thinking of writing some dragon age fiction so i wanted to get a good handle on the political situation and population centers of thedas  for this reasons i\u2019ll likely also be making a series of political maps detailing fereldan and orlais  \n\n 2 there weren\u2019t any good maps online that showed political borders so i wanted to introduce my headcanon to the general populace  \n\nas i mentioned earlier i used the vector drawing software inkscape to make the map  it took around a month likely only a couple days of actual labor but i\u2019m writing a thesis\n\n\n\nanderfels\n\ndesign  the anderfels are noted as being blightridden and much of the landscape consists of deserted steppes  as such i treated the area like i would a desert limiting most populations to areas around rivers and the coastline  the country covers a large area but likely has one of the smallest populations in thedas  as such despite the country being said to extend to the donarks there doesn\u2019t seem to be the population available to extend the control that far north\n\nthere are two ethnic groups in the anderfels the anders and the orth  the anders can be found in the valleys created by the lattenfluss river and around lakes  another group can be found around weisshaupt which tends to act more as the capital of the region then the seat of the king in hossberg\n\nthe orth are a nomadic society living in the wandering hills in the north  unlike the anders their light settlement can be more considered \u2018places where the orth are likely to be\u2019 rather than places that are continuously settled  this can be also seen with the various dalish clans\n\nheadcanon lore  the anders are noted as having their own separate language which named the darkspawn hurlocks genlock etc  i imagine them as being one of the first populations conquered by tevinter but largely left alone due to having little of value in their land perhaps they were raiders or something of the like  they maintained their own language and have largely resisted foreign encroachment on their lands\n\n\n\nseheron\n\ndesign  seheron is densely forested having a large jungle dominating the center of the island  despite this it is one of the oldest tevinter settlements and likely densely populated despite the largescale warfare that\u2019s taken place there  as such the only place completely barren of light settlement is the mountain range that runs alone the center and the densest jungle\n\nthere are four groups fighting over seheron the qunari the talvashoth the tevinters and the fog warriors  the qunari dominate the eastern portion of the island but face opposition everywhere else despite their nominal control  they have large settled populations near alam and near the large talvashoth contingent in the north but their main strength is the city of seheron and the outlying islands\n\nthe tevinters are largely hated on seheron due to the destructive nature of their war effort against the qunari but i gave them a still somewhat loyal population in the very south of the island mostly seen in the city of alam  this is simply because i doubt that all of the island would completely abandon the empire but this group is small and growing smaller the longer the imperium does not control the island\n\nthe fog warrior and the talvashoth are shown as one group though broad areas of control are labeled  as far as naming  the nahari are named after the \u2018cure of nahar\u2019 which brought the long lasting fog to the island  the warrior guerilla tactics that the fog warrior practice likely relies on the fog but the name also extends to the native population of the island that does not fight\nthe talvashoth occupy the northern peninsula of seheron  i am not sure if they seek to create a new nonqun state or if they simply wish to be left alone or if they are the beasts the qun claim them to be  in any case they have a large presence in the jungles of the island\n\nheadcanon lore  seheron and alam are quite large cities despite the destruction that encompassed much of the countryside  they used to be about equal in size but as both likely relied on the importation of food seheron has grown much larger while alam has grown weaker\n\n\n\npar vollen\n\ndesign  not much to say really as we know little about qunari homeland  the qunari control the entire island though the heavily forested interior is left alone  qunandar is extremely large and is the only largescale settlement on the island though much of the coastline is also likely heavily populated\n\nthe fex are a prequnari people who occupy parts of the eastern peninsula of the island  they are extremely few in number from what i can tell of the lore and likely are controlled politically by the qunari\n\nheadcanon lore  the native language of the fex has likely long been suppressed in favor of qunlat\n\n\n\ntevinter imperium\n\ndesign  due to tevinter being the longest existing human country in thedas i knew at the start that they would have a large amount of heavily populated areas  while likely smaller in population than orlais the tevinter imperium is quite strong and its reach extends into regions that have likely would have littletono settlement like the desert silent plains and the hundred pillars  they also control the arlathan forest preying upon the dalish there who still consider it their home\n\nthe population is concentrated on the coast with the vast majority of it located on the peninsula that minrathous rests on  like on seheron the high reaches mountain chain has little settlement and can be clearly seen on the map\n\na number of the surrounding islands also have large scale tevinter settlement and likely form bases of operation for actions against qunaricontrolled seheron\nheadcanon lore due to the longhistory of tevinter settlements i give a number of subtypes to their culture named after powerful cities and geographical areas  these identities do not compare in stature to loyalty to minrathous but a sort of

and body do not match in gender\n\nfurther transexuals can be sexually attracted to any sex that is to say they can be homosexual or heterosexual relative to either the sex they were designated as at

way shoot straight up until your trajectory goes up to 100km or so in the map view then cut the engine and wait to reach that altitude  at the top accelerate sideways parallel to the ground until your trajectory is an orbit  inefficient but easy\n\n minor improvement do a gravity turn  dont go straight up go at an angle instead  same principle get your trajectory to the desired altitude and cut the engines  when you reach the peak of the trajectory accelerate parallel to the ground until you have an orbit  you can also learn to use manoeuvre nodes\n\n more advanced improvement aim to the east on takeoff so that you benefit from the rotation of the planet  at all times try to aim close to the prograde indicator as that has the best efficiency  dont go too fast while youre still in the atmosphere as that too is inefficient  etc etc\n\ntheres always something to learn but there are ways to start easy first\n"], "AlanShoreHuha": ["have not but would like to try hasperat some day "],

celebration was fun i separated from my host family and looked around on my own there was a lot of drinking a lot of dancing and a lot of people the celebration was probably the biggest one i had seen in my whole life as i wandered through the celebrating hordes of people the music changed to almost militaristic and a countdown began i was sure it was only about 10 but i had a few drinks and went with it \n\nthe entire crowd was comparable to a mosh pit as the timer counted down from 60 people were throwing things into the air pushing each other around and generally acting barbaric the behavior increased in craziness as the timer reached 0 as the timer stopped the behavior changed from excited to rushed \na woman over a loud speaker addressed the crowd everyone operation yellowstone has been a success initiate lock down procedures \n\nmy phone rang as everyone began leaving and running to their homes i figured it was my host family telling me to go home but it was my dad before i left my dad and i had got into a fight with some choice words and i hadnt talked to him since when i answered i knew something was wrong\n\nmy dad was panicked and was asking me if i was ok i told him i was and asked him what was happening i wish i had never asked that question i wish i had never gotten that call my dad told me what had happened for some unknown reason their was a national emergency broadcasting through the united states they broadcast announced yellowstone had erupted for an unknown reason and told everyone to stay in there homes \n\nas he explained he told me he heard something my mom screamed and i received a dial tone i tried calling back but i got no answer\n\nafter the call the streets were no where near as crowded still some people running but most of the crowd gone i saw an abandoned bike and took it to my host families house along the way i only saw people praying homeless people scattered through streets and empty buildings cars burning and chaos from those out on the streets i got to my host house and saw the family through the window they were packing there things i threw the bike away and ran inside \n\nmy host family had bags of things and were running downstairs i followed without them knowing i had been in the basement multiple times but never saw what i saw then they pulled over a couch to reveal a heavy metal door my host dad pulled open the door to reveal a ladder before they went down i grabbed my host dads arm to stop him he spoke barely any english and was obviously not happy to see me he told me to leave get away find somewhere else to hide i refused to leave without answers \n\nhe then proceeded to pull a pocket knife from his pants pocket and lunged his wife and daughter cowering away from us he cut my arm a light cut but painful a pushed him back but he kept coming i took a small glass vase and waited for him to lung again as he charged with the knife i sidestepped and smashed the glass over his head he crumpled to the ground \n\nhis wife and daughter were crying and cowering i knew he would attack again when he woke up so i did the logical thing i went down the ladder in the hatch locking it shut as i descended the descent took longer than i expected and as i was going down all i heard was banging on the hatch door i finally made it down to solid ground and was greeted by a big cache of food and water beds and little light \n\nthe room was about the size of a large bedroom and was extremely dark  i took in my surroundings and found a desk with a desk lamp i turned it on to see a packet entitled the yellowstone protocol there wasnt much but the text goes as follows\n\ncongratulations you have survived the eruption of the yellowstone super volcano the great chinese empire has destroyed tyrannical america and in 10 short years we will be the world power once again all high ranking chinese leaders are safe as well as all tax paying lawabiding citizens you will have enough food for 3 people so as long as you followed the one child law you will live happily and safe in 10 years time a bell will go off to alert you it is finally safe to be above ground enjoy yourself in a short while everything will be just fine\n\ni write this to you for a couple reasons the biggest being sheer boredom considering ive been sitting down here for 10 years however i also want to write this so if anyone finds this they can know what happened here the bell went off weeks ago yet im too afraid to go to the surface however by writing this i know that if i die out there someone someday

have a smaller crosssectional area for their fuselage thus reducing aerodynamic drag    \n\n  other factors limiting airspeed such as heating from air friction would be less of a problem as the missile only has to last long enough to intercept its target\n\nfurthermore since the manned aircraft is being deployed into hostile territory it is possible that a dense air defence environment could launch missiles from two or more sites to surround an intruding aircraft so that whatever direction the intruder took to evade a missile it would face another one\n\na dense air defence system could include jamming to prevent the target detecting the approach of missiles\n\nturning away from a missile approaching headon at mach 6 will involve a turn with a large radius if the pilot is to avoid excessive gforces thus the missile could outmanouver it\n\na nucleartipped missile such as the boeing bomarchttpwwwastronautixcomlvsbomarchtm with its 10 kiloton warhead has a much larger kill radius

try to get things relaxed you can also do kegels and as you let go of the contraction focus on actually letting the muscles you just tightened relax fully take a minute or two between contractions to see if you can let the muscles release any further a physical therapist can teach you more exercises and explain how to use dilators there is options there besides having them even touch you if youre

the heating process every 4060 mins for as many hours as you like do this for many many days until the boots feel comfortable to wear without the thick socks etc basically the leather is super stiff and you need to soften it by wearing the heck out of your boots these boots last such a long time and honestly i think they are an amazing price for how long they last my friend has had hers for 6

legitimate criticism of what im saying not that you could come up with one it seems still for this comment ill drop the directs quotations of your post just so youll at least read it and to give you a break from being made to look a complete idiot quite as much as you have previously\n\nim not believing historians without question because ive actually studied the topic a bit wrote on it disagreed with some and agreed with others and dont believe in the ludicrous shit you do my prose isnt bad trust me i just like breaking down lengthy crap comments like yours on reddit into small sections because its convenient by the way your wording is terrible by your own admission and you spell poorly so if you really want to nitpick about writing style id suggest you do it to someone that is as thick as you are\n\ni dont sound like an emotionally immature 14 year old however the comments you make do make you sound like an utterly uninformed nazi apologist the assumptions im making are not random they are weighed up judgements about your character based on what you actually say youre completely averting the fact that the stabbed in the back idea is a myth benjamin freeman was an antisemitic lobbyist the fact that youre referencing him tells me a lot about your own beliefs either way the us joined the war for a few reasons if youre going to blame it on the jews at least be honest about it\n\nyour rant about talking in prose is funny particularly when you start it out by saying youre prose im not talking to my own argument im talking to you but with the format we are using im trying to address specific parts of your comment in an appropriate manner id rather do that especially when pointing out the specific errors of your horrid argument rather than do a lengthy prose piece that i dont need to \n\nyoure also criticising me for making assumptions when many of those assumptions are completely valid and when you make assumptions yourself that i am not learned on this subject or that you know your material and stuff like what semantics means when you obviously dont im blaming you for what you have said here in this discussion and what you have implied if youre going to repeat the same lingo used by people like stormfront users then you should expect to be subject to similar criticism what you said about the burden of proof is similarly whiny nonsense that boils down to this your feelings are hurt because ive called you out on being blatantly wrong about history good to know you dont understand how burden of proof works anyway\n\nim not making your comments into a multicomment of some sort either im just addressing individual parts of your comment in more detail im not writing you a prose essay when there is fundamentally no need to do so i wouldnt write prose in this manner normally and that should be obvious but you are just desperate now in looking for ways to criticise me because ive called out your argument the fact of the matter is that this is not a real life conversation or one over the phone it is a conversation by text communication on an internet content aggregator comments section ignoring whole comments because they actually try to add context to their criticism and debunk you in detail is really just an admission that you lack the intellectual capacity to make an argument\n\nall youre doing im afraid is whining whining that im not treating you with the same legitimacy that i would ascribe to someone who doesnt believe in complete bullshit you dont owe me evidence or explanation of course you dont but i dont owe you the etiquette of a polite academic historical debate when you are completely blind to historical evidence and cite the same evidence and turns of phrase of holocaust deniers youve insulted me a number of times which makes you quite the hypocrite and im the one who has actually focused on the subject matter youve just been talking about imaginary rules of etiquette for this sort of conversation and avoiding the topic for several posts\n\nim not going to fix my tone because some hack like you tells me to sorry buddy the reason im convinced that i cant learn anything from you is because youre wrong and nobody with any credibility with regards to the field of history agrees with you when youre done complaining avoiding the subject im the one staying on topic avoiding criticism and avoiding making any sort of argument and disregarding etiquette yourself then ill have a more civilised conversation with you until then youre literally just another nutter on the internet\n\n"],
